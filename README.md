# Digital Portfolio v0.1

## What?
Ever dreamt of having your awesome personal portfolio website? Have zero experience coding websites? Then you have come to the right place. Keep reading, and in a matter of minutes (read: a few days of frustration) you will have your website up and running.
## Why?
- To showcase my React.js/Next.js skills
- To give a tool to my friends to have an awesome digital portfolio (and stop asking me to build one for them)
- To start a _useful_ project, where devs of all skill levels can collaborate
- To prepare the front-end of a bigger project centered around digital resume/portfolio building
## How?
1. Populate `data/resume.min.json` file with your details (currently holds sample data with Harry Potter's info)
2. Deploy on your own, or if you don't know how to, keep reading
3. _Fool-proof instructions on going live (using Vercel) will go here_ 
## Technical Details

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/Container.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
